Linear Regression
Task: 
**Predict** a continuous value based on one or more inputs. A common example is 
predicting house prices based on features like size and number of bedrooms.<br>
**Why**: It helps understand how neural networks can approximate continuous functions.<br>
**Data**: Generate a synthetic dataset where the output is a linear combination of 
inputs, possibly with some added noise.<br>

[Why naming variables is important](https://github.com/MikhailKravets/NeuroFlow/blob/master/src/lib.rs)

[Good implementation but convoluted](https://github.com/jackm321/RustNN/blob/master/src/lib.rs)

[Better implementation didnt try it yet](https://github.com/Vercaca/NN-Backpropagation/blob/master/neural_network.py#L28)
